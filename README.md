# Syllabus
Syllabus and General information for CS World Class
We are going to use GitHub for our class so we can see how work gets done in the real world. GitHub allows you to keep your code organized, track changes and review and suggest changes for other students. 

## Getting Started with an Account
To get started, you need to create a GitHub (GH) account. This is pretty simple:

1. On GitHub.com choose the signup button.
2. Give yourself a username. You can use the same one we gave you or make something up.
3. Use your spencerville email address.
4. Set a password. I would recommend the one we gave you, but that is up to you.
5. Create your account.
6. Go to your email account at mail.spencerville.org and check for an email from GitHub.
7. Click the link in the email to verify your email address. (you will have to put in your username and password)
8. Add your GH username to the schoology GitHub Username quiz.
9. Go to your email again and click on the link to accept the invite.

Congratulations! Welcome to GitHub!

Now if you go to your dashboard you can see two items. Your activity, and then if you switch the context you will see the activity in CS World.

##Installing GitHub Desktop
Uploading our code to GitHub is much easier when we can use the GH application. 

1. Do a search for GitHub Desktop on google. You should see a link to download GitHub desktop.
2. Click download and then run the downloaded application when finished. 
3. Login with your Username and Password.
4. Configure your name you want to commit as and use your spencerville email.
5. Click next. It should say not repositories found. Then go to the Dashboard.
6. Follow the tutorial that talks about how to use GH Desktop.
7. If the tutorial isn't working. Close GH Desktop and then reopen it.

Nice job! Now you should know about branches, committs and pull requests. Well Kind of anyway. Next we are going to connect up to our repositories and get a copy on your desktop.

##Cloning to the Desktop
Now we are going to clone the repository to the desktop so you can start to work with a branch of the document.

1. Go into the website repository on GH.
2. Click the Clone in Desktop button. (If asked, tell it to Lauch Application)
3. If this doesn't work to get it into GH Desktop, then in GHD, click the + sign in the upper left corner.
4. Choose the Clone word/tab.
5. Choose the SAA-CS-World-2015 organization. 
6. Select website.
7. Click the Checkmark Clone button at the bottom of the pane.
8. Now it will ask you where you want to save it. It may suggest GitHub under your Documents folder. This is a good place for it.
9. With website selected on the left hand side, click the branch button. (It's to the left of the master button.)
10. Give it either the name of your group, or your personal name if you are working on a personal level.

After you click to create the branch, you will notice that the master button now has the name of your branch. Now you can edit the files in the website folder and they will not affect the main branch. Any new things that I add to the main branch you can update to your branch as long as it doesn't conflict with something you have done.

*important! Make sure you are always in your branch in GHD before making edits to your documents.*

##Edit the Design Document
You will now find the design document inside the folder where you created your branch on your local computer.

1. Edit that document and use it's format to create your final design document.
2. Save your changes. 
3. Committ your changes.
4. Sync your changes to GH.

##Uploading Code
Next we will add your code file inside the web folder. You can also use the boilerplate (sample) code to help you get started on a file if you need it.
