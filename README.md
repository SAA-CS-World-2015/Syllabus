# Syllabus
Syllabus and General information for CS World Class
We are going to use GitHub for our class so we can see how work gets done in the real world. GitHub allows you to keep your code organized, track changes and review and suggest changes for other students. 

## Getting Started with an Account
To get started, you need to create a GitHub (GH) account. This is pretty simple:

1. On GitHub.com choose the signup button.
2. Give yourself a username. You can use the same one we gave you or make something up.
3. Use your spencerville email address.
4. Set a password. I would recommend the one we gave you, but that is up to you.
5. Create your account.
6. Go to your email account at mail.spencerville.org and check for an email from GitHub.
7. Click the link in the email to verify your email address. (you will have to put in your username and password)
8. Add your GH username to the schoology GitHub Username quiz.
9. Go to your email again and click on the link to accept the invite.

Congratulations! Welcome to GitHub!
